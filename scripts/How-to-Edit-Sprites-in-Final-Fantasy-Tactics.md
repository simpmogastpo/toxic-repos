## What You Need
  
To edit sprites in Final Fantasy Tactics, you will need the following:
  
- An image file of Final Fantasy Tactics. This can be an ISO file that you can create from your original game disc or download from a reputable source. You will need this file to extract and import the sprites.
- A sprite editor. This is a program that allows you to view and modify the sprites. There are several options for this, such as FFT Sprite Manager[^1^], Darthatron's FFTA Editor[^2^], or WOTL Sprite Editor[^3^]. Each of these programs has its own features and limitations, so you might want to try them out and see which one suits your needs best.
- A graphics program. This is a program that allows you to edit the colors and pixels of the sprites. You will need this to change the appearance of the sprites according to your preferences. Some examples of graphics programs are Graphics Gale, GIMP, or Photoshop. You will need a program that can edit palettes, which are the sets of colors that are used for the sprites.
- A CD image editor. This is a program that allows you to insert and extract files from your Final Fantasy Tactics image file. You will need this to replace the original sprites with your edited ones. Some examples of CD image editors are CD Mage, UMDgen, or UltraISO.

## How to Edit Sprites
  
Once you have all the tools ready, you can follow these steps to edit sprites in Final Fantasy Tactics:

1. Open your CD image editor and extract the sprite files from your Final Fantasy Tactics image file. The sprite files are located in the BATTLE folder and have the extension .SPR. You can use the names of the files to identify which sprite belongs to which character or job. For example, ARUMA.SPR is Alma's sprite, RAMUZA1.SPR is Ramza's sprite in Chapter 1, and THIEF\_M.SPR is the male thief sprite.
2. Open your sprite editor and import the sprite file that you want to edit. You will see a preview of the sprite and its portrait on the screen. You can also see the palette that is used for the sprite on the right side of the screen.
3. Export the sprite as a bitmap file (.BMP) and save it somewhere on your computer. You will need this file to edit the sprite in your graphics program.
4. Open your graphics program and open the bitmap file that you exported. You will see the sprite and its portrait on a grid of pixels. You can zoom in and out to see the details better.
5. Edit the sprite as you wish using your graphics program. You can change the colors, shapes, sizes, or positions of the pixels. However, you have to follow some rules and limitations when editing sprites:
    - You have to use only the colors that are in the palette. You cannot add new colors or change the palette itself. If you want to use different colors, you have to replace some of the existing ones in the palette.
    - You have to keep the same dimensions and proportions of the sprite. You cannot make it bigger or smaller than it originally was. If you want to change the size of some parts of the sprite, you have to adjust other parts accordingly.
    - You have to keep the same number of frames for each animation of the sprite. You cannot add or remove frames from an animation. If you want to change how an animation looks, you have to edit each frame individually.
    - You have to keep some parts of the sprite consistent with other sprites of the same job or class. For example, if you edit a generic knight sprite, you have to make sure that it still looks like a knight and not like a different job or class.

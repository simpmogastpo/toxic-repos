If you want to enjoy the best version of The Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition, you need to update your game to version 3.4. Here are some ways you can do that:
 
## Method 1: Automatic Update via Game Launcher
 
If you have an active internet connection, the game will automatically update to version 3.4 when you run the game launcher and confirm that you wish to update the game to its newest version. This is the easiest and fastest way to update your game.
 
## Method 2: Manual Update via Enhanced Edition Downloader
 
If you have a retail copy of the release (1.0) version of The Witcher 2, which requires patching to run, you can use the Enhanced Edition Downloader to manually update your game to version 3.4. The downloader is a tool that downloads and installs all the necessary files for the Enhanced Edition, including patch 3.4. To use the Enhanced Edition Downloader:

1. Click [here](https://en.cdprojektred.com/download/enhanced-edition-patch-3-0/) to download the downloader and run it.
2. Carefully read and follow the instructions in the downloader.
3. Do not change the directory of the downloaded files until you update your game.
4. Be sure that all the downloaded files are saved to the same directory.

Please note that this method is not compatible with the Steam version of the game, which uses the Steam auto-patching system.
 
## Method 3: Manual Update via Separate Files
 
If you have a vanilla (non-Enhanced Edition) installation of The Witcher 2, you can also manually update your game to version 3.4 by downloading and installing separate files. To do this:

1. Click [here](https://en.cdprojektred.com/download-category/patch/) to access the patch archives.
2. Download and install patch 3.0, which upgrades your game to Enhanced Edition.
3. Download and install patch 3.1, which fixes some issues with patch 3.0.

5. Download and install patch 3.3, which fixes some bugs and glitches.
6. Download and install patch 3.4, which is the latest and final patch for the game.

Please note that this method is not for Steam users, as it will render the game incompatible with Steam. The Steam version of The Witcher 2 is already updated to version 3.4 from the moment of installation.
